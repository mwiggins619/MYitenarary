- SPELLING!!! (I spent 45 min because you inverted itinerary and user model :/ )
- refactor and clean code as you progress, (too many console log everywhere makes it hard to debug)
- be carefull when copy pasting from other components, some naming and comments are very confusing, as well as your use of singular and plural forms
- rethink your model: name of itinerary is unique so only one itinerary can exist...
- passing parameters with rest....( req boby,... ) 
- respect api function parameters (body goes before authentification). check documentation if needed
- install all packages with npm i so they are in packages.json
- organise your folder structure: images go asset folder...
_ a lot of front end issues to fix (fileds not aligned, button not conected )
- fix the warnings
- keep in mind that you will code with other people. It is very hard to understand where you are going
